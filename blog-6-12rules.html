          12 Rules to learn to code.
        </h1>

            <h1>#1 Trick your brain with a 20min rule. </h1>
            <p>
              Learning to code is a bit like going to the gym. Even if you max out and spent a whole weekend at the gym,
              you will not see a visible difference in your body. The more regularly you learn to code, the more likely
              it is that you’ll start seeing your ripped coding muscles. (The irony is not lost on me).

            </p>
            <p>But the problem is where do you find the time? Between working your
              full-time job, spending time with your family and life admin, when are you supposed to sit down and
              practice this “daily coding”?
            </p>
            <p>While I was working as a doctor, I spent about 12 hours at the hospital, 1-hour commuting and
              approximately 2 hours on general life-sustaining
              stuff, such as eating. So that left me with only 9 hours remaining in my day. Theoretically, 2 hours could
              be allocated to coding practice and 7 hours on sleep. But there is nothing more difficult than trying to
              convince your
              work-saturated brain to sit down and learn when you could be watching Game of Thrones with a tub of
              ice-cream.
            </p>
            <p>But then I found a trick.</p>

            <p>As humans, we have a lot of inertia. This can be bad for us - I’m looking at you, “24” box set. However,
              we can also turn it to our advantage. I found that once I got started coding and making things, I got so
              absorbed into the project, that I no longercared about TV, food or sleep. There were quite a few weekends
              when I coded until sunrise.
            </p>
            <p>So how do we take advantage of this inertia? First, you must understand that task-switching is very
              difficult. It requires a lot of motivation. If as soon as you get home, you slump on the sofa and switch
              on the TV, you’ve already lost that evening. This is because the amount of motivation required to
              task-switch and do something not driven by evolution like eating or sleeping is a Herculean task.</p>
            <p>This is why the moment you enter the door and change to a new environment is the most crucial moment. If
              at this moment, you tell yourself that you are just going to do 20 minutes of coding practice, you will
              most likely succeed and use your own inertia to end up learning for an hour or more. No brain will
              perceive a 20-minute task as a lot of effort and you end up tricking your brain to take advantage of your
              evening.</p>
            <p>The next step is to develop a habit. Research suggests that in order to develop a new habit, you have to
              carry out the task daily for a month. I’ve used this next trick for loads of different things, from
              exercising to coding, it invariably works like a charm. To preface this trick, I want you to imagine a
              wall with five paintings hanging on it, four of which are perfectly aligned, perfectly horizontal, but one
              is crooked. Now really imagine it, is there a part of you that wants to fix it?</p>
            <p>Now let’s imagine a monthly calendar with boxes representing individual days. If you nurtured that new
              habit on a particular day, then you make a line through that day. If you continued your streak the next
              day then you extend that line and so on and so forth. There is something about not breaking a continuous
              line that motivates most people to continue to
              develop a habit. As strange as it sounds, there are many times when I would have given up, but compelled
              to continue because of a long, continuous line.
            </p>


            <h1> # 2
              Code for a purpose
            </h1>

            <p>When I first started learning how to code, there were countless times when I picked it up then gave up,
              again and again. This is a common story amongst self-taught coders. Looking back, after teaching so many
              students, I finally realise what’s going on. A lot of beginners start learning to code by picking an
              arbitrary language and follow along with a bunch of tutorials. Copying code, line by line, sometimes
              writing code to work out prime numbers, other times to find all the even numbers. But you know what? I can
              find prime numbers a lot faster by Googling for it and picking out even numbers is really not all that
              interesting.</p>

            <p>Here’s the truth. If you are learning to code for the sake of learning to code, it’ll be pretty difficult
              for you to get good at it. Skills that require a lot of time to hone, like programming, will eat into your
              pool of internal motivation. Something from within that makes you forget to eat and sleep. I can honestly
              say that coding on my own projects is one of the most enjoyable things I do. It combines logical thinking
              with creativity, and at the end, you will have made something. In most cases, something that the world has
              never seen. Something that could make your life easier or more enjoyable. Something that could make loads
              of people's lives easier and more enjoyable. It’s like making a crazy-beautiful custom motorbike in your
              garage, without needing the garage or spending a cent on the components.</p>

            <p>This is what motivates most people. The creating part. The making part. So I urge you to start learning
              to code by following a tutorial that makes
              something, anything. Of course, it’s unlikely that at the beginning you’ll be able to code up Clash of
              Clans or League of Legends. But you’ll be able to make something interesting. It could be a dice game or a
              flash-card app. But as long at the end of the tutorial, you’ll have made something you can use and play
              with, then you’ll be far more motivated to code to the end.
            </p>
            <p>During all our courses, we always tell our students to think up of a simple app that they want to make.
              Something that uses the skills that they’ve learnt during the course but will also stretch them a little
              because they have to find out how to include some new functionality.</p>

            <p>We had a student who went on to make an app that wakes them up a minute earlier every day to ease the
              transition to an earlier waking time. There’s a student who made a custom slideshow app as a mother’s day
              present. Someone else made an app that is a timer for making perfect steaks based on its weight and
              thickness.</p>

            <p>There are no limits on your imagination. It will be difficult when you start working on your own app
              because there are no step-by-step instructions, but it will also bring about the biggest improvement in
              your coding ability.</p>


            <h1> # 3
              There is no "Perfect" language to learn.
            </h1>

            <p>Whenever I do large talks, there will always be one person who asks me “which programming language should
              I start learning first”? There is this common perception that somewhere out there lies a perfect language
              for beginner programmers. Some argue it’s Python, some say it’s Swift.</p>

            <p>But I say they’re all wrong.</p>
            <p>A programming language is simply a tool. It is no different from any other tool in your hardware box. If
              you want to hammer a nail, you should be using a hammer. If you want to fix your water pipes, you’ll
              probably need a spanner. Yes, it’s possible to hammer in a nail using the side of the spanner and the same
              programming language can be used to solve different types of problems. The carpenter will tell you that
              his favourite tool is a hammer and the plumber will say it’s the spanner, but it still doesn’t make it the
              “best tool to fix things”.</p>

            <p>A web developer will tell you that JavaScript is the best language to learn for a beginner. A
              statistician will advise you that you’ll be best served with the R programming language. But at the end of
              the day, all that matters is what you are trying to do with your tool. If you want to make iOS apps, then
              learn Swift. If you want to make websites, you’ll need JavaScript. But the good news is the core
              programming concepts: loops, conditionals, functions, etc. they’re all the same. The difference is mostly
              syntactical. In English, we have werewolves, in German they have Werwölfe. It’s still the same
              shirt-ripping mammal that comes out during a full moon, it’s just spelt differently.
            </p>

            <p>Printing to the console in Swift:
              <p> <code>  print(“Hello Werewolves”)</code>
              </p>

              <p> Printing to the console in Java:
                <p> <code>    println(“Hello Werwölfe”)</code>
                </p>
                <p>So, decide on the task that you are trying to accomplish, then pick the best tool for that task.</p>




                <h1> # 4
                  Understand what you are writing.
                </h1>

                <p>I have an issue with the way that most programming tutorials are written. There are far too many
                  tutorials where you see the “this is how you draw an owl” phenomenon.</p>

                <p>It’s almost as if the programmer had good intentions and started off by showing you how to do
                  everything, step-by-step. But then, at some point, he realises that he has embarked on a Sisyphean
                  task and gives up. I’ve seen tutorials where the author starts off with an excruciating level of
                  detail then mid-way reverts to “now you simply set up a cloud database”. Bearing in mind that this is
                  a tutorial aimed at beginners!</p>

                <p>This leads to a number of problems. The most common problem is a student who just copies the code in
                  the tutorial and has no clue what any of it does. Why did he add that extra line after parsing the
                  JSON? Why is he making this dictionary differently from the last one?</p>

                <p>It’s very easy to get knees deep in one of these types of tutorials because it promises to teach you
                  how to build “Flappy Bird” or “Candy Crush”. But
                  two-thirds of the way in, none of the things you’re typing makes sense and you start seeing red all
                  over the screen. Bugs. Loads of them. Why? No idea. Nothing runs. The last 3 hours were spent copying
                  code and you learnt nothing other than maybe that coding sucks.
                </p>


                <p>Don’t get into this trap. If you see a tutorial that has jumps from beginner to advanced after line 3
                  or uses the word “simply” too liberally or doesn’t explain any of their code, then stop. Leave that
                  tutorial. </p>

                <p> There’s plenty of fish in the sea.</p>

                <p>Other times, the author does try to explain what they’re doing. But you still don’t understand a
                  thing that they’re saying, then you’re in an advanced tutorial that won’t improve your programming. It
                  can be tempting to build grand things, especially when the blog is promising that anyone can make it.
                  But if you can’t work out what’s going on, you’re be better served by building a better foundation.
                </p>

                <p> The key to learning to code is all about ramping. You want to be stretched over and over again and
                  forknowledge to be built on previous knowledge. If that ramp is too steep, you’ll get lost. If that
                  ramp
                  is too shallow, you’ll get bored. The right gradient is different for everyone. That’s why we
                  encourage
                  students to use the speed change functionality liberally on our tutorials. This way, you can listen at
                  double speed if you’re comfortable with the concepts and slow down to half speed if it’s something
                  unfamiliar and you need time to understand and absorb.
                </p>




                <h1> # 5
                  It's okay to not know.
                </h1>

                <p>Software engineers are purportedly the profession that has the largest population of Imposter
                  Syndrome sufferers. Imposter Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where people feel like frauds and
                  massively underestimate their own skills and abilities.</p>


                <div><img src="img/blog6-ntp.png" style="width: 700px;   display: block;
                    margin-left: auto;
                    margin-right: auto;" alt="chart"></div>
                <p>Programmers tend to be self-critical and constantly feel that everyone else is better at programming
                  than they. If you’ve ever felt this way, you’re not alone, as studies show that a massive 70 percent
                  of people have imposter syndrome.</p>

                <p>I recently saw a post on the Q&A site Quora where somebody asked:
                  <a href="  https://www.quora.com/Would-I-get-fired-at-Google-or-another-big-tech-firm-if-I-got-caught-using-Stack-Overflow-as-a-reference"
                    style="color: blue;">“Would
                    I get fired at Google (or another big tech firm if I got caught using StackOverflow as a
                    reference?”</a>
                </p>

                <p>He got a bunch of really great answers from engineers working at Google, Amazon and other major tech
                  companies. Anybody who has worked as a software engineer will tell you that not looking at references
                  is far more frowned upon. In fact, I challenge you to find a single Google programmer who has not used
                  Stack Overflow. (If you’re not familiar, StackOverflow is a collaborative Q&A site for programmers).
                </p>


                <p>A lot of new programmers are afraid that by checking references and asking people for help they will
                  out themselves as a fraud who doesn’t know to programme. Nobody can hold all the relevant information
                  in their head. For example, this is the name of an iOS method:</p>


                <p>
                  <code>- (id)initWithBitmapDataPlanes:(unsigned char **)planes pixelsWide:(NSInteger)width pixelsHigh:(NSInteger)height bitsPerSample:(NSInteger)bps samplesPerPixel:(NSInteger)spp hasAlpha:(BOOL)alpha isPlanar:(BOOL)isPlanar colorSpaceName:(NSString *)colorSpaceName bitmapFormat:(NSBitmapFormat)bitmapFormat bytesPerRow:(NSInteger)rowBytes bitsPerPixel:(NSInteger)pixelBits;</code>
                </p>

                <p>It’s almost 400 characters!</p>

                <p>In iOS programming, there are over 800 classes, 9000 methods and growing. In web development, there’s
                  a new framework every week. No one will expect you to be able to remember the code. This is the
                  precise reason why we are programmers, we can get the computer to do the boring stuff
                  for us. For example, the code for recording sound is only a short search away, why would you need to
                  memorise it?
                </p>
                <p>The skill that most employers look for when recruiting is the ability to think. Knowledge is valued
                  in a world where information is hard to come by. In the 1800s, only the rich had access to good books
                  and good teachers. Now, everyone has all the information they had and more at the tap of a mouse.
                  Information is losing value, the ability to think is the stock to buy. So don’t be afraid to search,
                  to ask on StackOverflow or to find resources to help you solve your issues. The best programmers do
                  it.</p>

                <p>The skill you need to hone is in asking good questions and understanding the answer. There is no
                  point copy-pasting code from a StackOverflow answer if you have no clue how it works. Because
                  StackOverflow works on a reputation system, it’s in their interest to be as clear as possible in their
                  answer in order to be marked as correct and collect upvotes.</p>
                <p>In most cases, it doesn’t make sense to start searching StackOverflow whenever you get stuck. The
                  first option should always be trying to figure it out yourself. So your program doesn’t do what you
                  expected it to, but before I typed the last 3 lines of code, it was working fine. So let’s figure out
                  what in those last 3 lines broke my app?</p>

                <p>If you really can’t figure it out, start with Google. Search for your query or if you have a bug
                  paste the error codes and the error message. Chances are that as a beginner, your programming woes
                  will be very common and somebody might have even taken the time to write a clear and concise tutorial
                  to help you understand your bug. As you grow more skilled in programming, the problems you’ll
                  encounter get more and more obscure, but hopefully, if you followed the other 11 rules, you will also
                  be a more
                  capable programmer and figure it out yourself or know exactly where to get help.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other reason why you should start with Google is that StackOverflow’s search algorithm organises
                  questions and answers by recency and not popularity. A lot of the problems you will encounter while
                  starting out will have been asked and answered years ago but still massively popular.
                  So ask wisely and you will reap the benefits from the community. One day when you yourself become a
                  code

                <h1> # 6 Be a Copycat.
                </h1>

                <p>At the beginning of my coding journey, I thought the way to learn to code was to read a whole bunch
                  of books. I bought books on C++, C#, Java and loads more. You name it, I had it. But they didn’t do
                  very much other than making me confused.</p>

                <p>I read. I highlighted. I forgot. I fell asleep.</p>

                <p>Books are good as references. If you want to dive deep into delegates and protocols, read the chapter
                  on that. But if you want to learn, <strong> make something</strong>.</p>

                <p>But what do you make?</p>

                <p>Lacking in ideas? Be a copycat. Make your own notepad, make your own MSPaint, make your own piano. If
                  you’re into games, make minesweeper, make Tetris, make Flappy Bird. Not only will they be sort-of
                  useful, but they’ll also be the perfect opportunity for you to figure out how to do things and get
                  experience in finding help. Something that is brand new to the world like holographic smartphone
                  projections, no one will be able to help you with. By making copycat apps or programs, you’ll be
                  treading in the path that many have walked before you. This way you maximise the chances that someone
                  will be able to offer you help and advice when you get stuck.</p>


                <h1> # 7 Be Accountable.
                </h1>
                <p>Be accountable to someone. Show your work.</p>
                <p>
                  The biggest problem with online coding courses is the lack of accountability. No doubt there are loads
                  of great Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), such as Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Skillshare. But what
                  are the consequences of not doing your homework or missing a month’s worth of lectures? Nothing.
                  Nobody cares.
                </p>

                <p>Let’s face it, internal motivation is not strong in any of us. We can always find a reason why we
                  deserve to “Netflix and chill”. I can’t even count how many online courses I’ve signed up to and
                  subsequently not listened to a single lecture or completed a single piece of coursework.</p>

                <p>You need accountability and commitment to learning. Think back to your university days, would have
                  bothered to finish that essay at 3 AM if nothing depended on it? Would you have gone to any of the
                  lectures if you didn’t care about passing or failing?</p>


                <p>This is why we try to introduce accountability into our courses. We’ve realised that matching up
                  students with a buddy helps. Someone else who is a beginner, at the same level as you who sometimes
                  helps you and other times needs your help. Sometimes, as people’s learning rates diverge or if you’re
                  paired up with a lazy bugger, you can swap it up and get a new buddy. Because this system is entirely
                  voluntary, there a degree of
                  self-selection for people who work well in teams and are motivated by
                  others. Just as you’re more likely to go to the gym if you sign up with your partner, you’re more
                  likely to learn if you have a coding buddy.

                </p>
                <p>So if you’re not on our course then find your own. There’s plenty of Facebook groups dedicated to
                  those who are learning to code. There’s an entire subreddit (r/learnprogramming) dedicated to this,
                  I’m sure you’ll find like-minded people somewhere online or offline.</p>



                <p>The next thing I’m going to tell you will be controversial. We believe that people don’t value things
                  that don’t have a value. This is the reason why Coursera is taking down a large number of their free
                  courses. They saw that millions of people were signing up for it but no one was taking any of the
                  classes let alone complete any of the projects. It was actually detrimental to students’ learning to
                  offer a free course. We all have a degree of hoarding tendencies and it’s very easy to signup for a
                  bunch of stuff that the
                  future-you can suffer through. There’s always tomorrow, she says.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So if you are driven more by external motivation than internal, try to use a little bit of financial
                  motivation to drive your learning. Think about how much a life skill is worth to you and put your
                  money
                  where your intentions are.
                  See if you’re engaging with the course content more with or without the financial commitment. There
                  are
                  plenty of places where you can pay something affordable to motivate yourself to start a regular
                  learning
                  habit.</p>

                <p>The final part of this rule is to try and find ways of getting assessed. Ok, so getting assessed is
                  right up there with death and taxes in terms of how much people enjoy it. But when learning anything,
                  it’s always important to get feedback. You will get an objective assessment of your current skill
                  level, instead of feeling like an imposter or brimming with false confidence.
                  Coursera has a system where the students mark each other's’ work. At the App Brewery, we use Github
                  education to test your code and look for bugs
                  and problems with your code. But if you’re on a coding course that doesn't have a system like this,
                  then it’ll be worth your while to find a code mentor who can review your code and give you feedback.
                  Only what’s measured can be improved.
                </p>




                <h1> # 8 Keep Learning.
                </h1>
                <p>Being a good programmer is a bit like being Madonna.</p>

                <p>Don’t run out and buy your cone-shaped bras just yet. What I mean is programming will keep evolving.
                  In order to stay relevant, you have to keep re-inventing yourself.</p>

                <p>There’s always new trends, new technologies and new languages. Great programmers relish in learning
                  new things, even if it means they become a beginner again.</p>

                <p>The world will keep moving, if you stay in one place, you’ll eventually be left behind. I know
                  programmers who never learnt anything else apart from Fortran. I know Objective-C programmers who
                  can’t persuade themselves to make the leap and learn Swift, even though Apple is telling developers
                  that Objective-C will be phased out. We all know that Apple never makes threats that they don’t carry
                  out, just look at the optical drive (and soon the headphone jack?).</p>

                <p>Don’t be the optical drive. Or rather, don’t be the laptop that’s still trying to play CDs. If your
                  needs change, learn to use a new tool. Keep learning, stay relevant.</p>

                <p>Are you a web developer who always wanted to get into mobile development? Pick a platform and learn
                  iOS or Android. Are you a front-end developer who is tempted by the full-stack? Pick up web
                  development with
                  Node. If you already understand the core programming concepts, picking up a few more languages will be
                  a lot easier than starting from scratch.
                </p>

                <p>“Learn x in y minutes” is a great resource for existing programmers to learn new programming
                  languages. Check out their resources here: <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/"

                <h1> # 9 Play Foosball.
                </h1>

                <p>
                  When you see Hollywood movies about programmers, they’re usually sat in front of a laptop, mashing the
                  keyboard like they’re in some sort of
                  high-stakes “smash the mole” game.
                </p>
                <p>When you see real programmers working. They tend to look like this:</p>


                <div><img src="img/blog6-staring.png" style="width: 500px;   display: block;
                  margin-left: auto;

                <p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Yep, that’s right. No typing. Just staring. A lot of
                    staring.</strong></p>

                <p>In a company, people tend to complain that the programmers are always playing foosball or doing
                  something else that doesn’t look like work. People might not be able to tell, but they are in fact
                  working.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">


                  <strong>Other people might not understand, but in these situations, it’s almost always worth stepping
                    away
                    from your code and giving it some time and distance.</strong></p>

                <p>Do you have a bug in your code that you can’t work out? Sleep on it, play foosball, go for a walk. In
                  9 out of 10 cases, the solution will become apparent. In the remaining 1 out of 10 cases, you’re just
                  screwed.</p>

                <p>This may sound unintuitive, but my advice is always to code less, think more. Once the poorly
                  thought-out code is written and brought into the world, you’ll inevitably have to go back and comb
                  through your code, line-by-line, refactoring and deleting things. This is always a painful experience.
                </p>

                <p>So remember, the easiest code to get rid of is the code that was never written.</p>



                <h1> # 10 Get a Mentor.
                </h1>

                <p>When I was learning French, I came across a method that resulted in the greatest leap in my speaking
                  abilities. That was having language exchanges over Skype. I would pair up with a native French speaker
                  who wanted to learn English. We would spend half an hour speaking French and half an hour speaking
                  English. We would both dedicate an hour each week to improving the language that we were trying to
                  learn.</p>

                <p>While we were having a conversation in French, he would correct my pronunciation or grammar and
                  suggest the ways that I could construct my sentences to sound more native.</p>
                <p>Pair programming is an agile software development technique that’s based on very similar principles.
                  For example, a learner and a mentor would sit down at the same workstation and work on a problem. The
                  learner is in charge of writing code and the mentor reviews the code line-by-line as they are written.
                </p>

                <p>It can be uncomfortable at first because it’s a bit embarrassing making mistakes and having them
                  pointed out to you. But if you have a mentor who is a good teacher then they will offer you decades of
                  accumulated wisdom that can lead to massive improvements in your own ability, all within a few hours.
                </p>


                <p>You’ll get to tap into someone who’s had the time to hone their skills, find efficient ways of doing
                  things and show you how they program and approach problems.</p>

                <p>Good mentors don’t solve your problems, rather they practice the Socratic method of asking good
                  questions that get you to think for yourself. If you ask me how to write a networking call, of course,
                  I can simply type it all out and get you to copy it. But that doesn’t help you. Instead, if you show
                  me how you approach the problem and I show you how I approach the problem then you can learn so much
                  more than just following a recipe.</p>


                <p>The next time you encounter a different problem, you can apply the same approach and start solving it
                  yourself. Always remember that information is cheap. A century ago, if I wanted to learn about the
                  causes of disease, I probably had to be an aristocrat, or chop wood and carry water for a master and
                  become their apprentice. Nowadays I can search Google and get my answer in a few seconds.</p>

                <p>So don’t get hung up on information. Learn to think instead. How to approach a problem. How to break
                  down the problem. How to frame the problem. These skills will take you much further than simple
                  memorisation and regurgitation.</p>


                <p>But where do you find a mentor?</p>

                <p>There are programming related Meetups happening in almost every city in the world. Go to

                  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" style="color: blue;"> www.meetup.com</a></p>
                <a href="  "></a> and find one related to a language you’re trying to learn. Attend the meetups, get to
                know people. Exchange your expertise for their expertise. Maybe someone needs an accountant, maybe
                someone needs legal advice. Exchange your time for their time. Don’t say to someone, “will you be my
                mentor?”. No one wants to throw away their free
                time for some stranger. Instead, offer your help in return for their help and you’ll be successful in
                finding a mentor 95% of the time.

              <h1> # 11 Get into the Habit of Chunking.
              </h1>

              <p>So you have an awesome app idea. But it’s way-way-way too complicated for your current skill level.
                What do you do? You join the Chunking Express.</p>
              <p>Nope, I’m not talking about the art house movie. I’m talking about breaking down your programming
                problem.</p>

              <p>Let’s say that you’re trying to make a robot that can butter toast. (If anyone is working on one of
                these I’d happily fund your Kickstarter!) The robot doesn't know anything about toast or butter or
                knives. Believe it or not, it actually takes pretty sophisticated circuitry in our brains to be able to
                achieve something as simple as buttering a slice of toast. (This is probably why I can’t seem to do it
                without coffee).</p>
              <p>So creating a robot that does all of that autonomously is really complicated and difficult. But as
                we’re good programmers, we can do some chunking and break down the problem.</p>


              <p>The robot doesn’t really need to know what is toast and what is butter, we’re not making Skynet here,
                so let’s just stick to the practical things. There are three things we need the robot to do:</p>

              <ul>
                <li> 1. Pick up and arrange the piece of toast in the ideal buttering position.</li>
              </ul>
              <li> 2. Pick up a serving of butter.</li>
              </ul>
              <li> 3. Place butter on toast with decent coverage (this is the part I find most difficult).</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Next, you break each module down even further. In the process, you can think about alternate ways of
                solving the problem. For example, does the robot need to “spread” the butter? Or can it just melt the
                butter onto the toast? Does it need to learn to pick up a knife? Or can it have some sort of inbuilt
                knife-arm, like some sort of prison shiv pirate?</p>

              <p>The more that you break down problems and define the issue that you’re trying to solve, the easier it
                is to package your code into bite-sized chunks. The simpler the chunk, the easier it is to tackle.</p>
              <p>So the next time that you’re trying to make that “cross between Snapchat and Evernote”, remember to
                break down the problem into solvable chunks.</p>

              <h1> # 11 Break someone else's code.
              </h1>
              <p>One of the most important steps to take in order to make the jump from learner coder to a fully fledged
                programmer is understanding how to get help. Everyone needs help. Everyone, including those so-called
                “God Level Programmers”.</p>

              <p>But what you do with the help will determine how fast you progress as a coder. On a site like
                StackOverflow, it can be very tempting to just copy and paste the code that someone has provided. Your
                program works exactly as you hoped it would and off you go on your merry programming ways. This exercise
                didn’t teach you anything other than code reliance. Because the next time you encounter the same problem
                but in a different situation, that same code snippet that someone provided may not work anymore. Then
                what do you do? You’re stuck.</p>


              <p>That’s why there’s a rule in programming that says “never copypaste code that you don’t understand”. So
                what should you do when you’re confronted with a block of code that solves your problem but you have no
                clue how it works? Break it down.</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Step 1 - Copy and paste the code into your program. (yes, yes, I know I just said not to do that,
                  patience, patience).</li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Step 2 - Make sure that your program or application is functioning as expected. I.e. confirm that
                block of
                code really did solve your problem.</li>
              </ul>
              <li> Step 3 - Delete the copy and pasted block of code line by line.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Step 4 - Each time you delete a line, check to see what’s been broken. Does the app still run? What
                  are
                  the error codes? What has deleting that line of code done to your program?</li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Step 5 - Even if you think you know what a line of code does, delete it anyway. The most important
                task as
                a programmer is to always test your assumptions against the outcome. For the most enjoyable feeling as
                a
                programmer is for the real world to validate your assumptions. You know how nice it is when your
                boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife says those magical three words?
                You were right”.
                It’s like that, but better.
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li> Step 6 - Swap some of the lines around. Can the same functionality be achieved with a different
                  order of
                  lines? Why were they written in the order they were written in?
                </li>
              </ul>


              <p>By breaking the solution code, line-by-line, you’ll learn and understand what each line does and why
                it’s been written. This is a far better way to use code from other people than just pasting it in and
                hoping for the best. Once you understand why each of those lines was necessary, the next time you
                encounter a similar problem, you’ll be able to tease out the problem and solve it yourself.</p>

              <p>Once you’ve mastered breaking code from StackOverflow, the next resource to target is GitHub. It’s a
                tool used by programmers for collaboration but it is also one of the largest repositories of open source
                code.</p>
              <p>So how can you use it to become a better programmer? Let’s say that you want to make an Instagram
                clone. But unfortunately, you don’t know how to do that. So you head over to github.com and search
                “Instagram” or “photo app”.</p>

              <p>Inevitably, there will be something written in Swift/Objective-C/Java that you can download and take a
                look at.
                Think about the structure of their program. Take a look at all the classes, the constants, the
                interplay. Make some modifications to the code. Does it still work or have you broken it? Why did you
                break it? Is there a link that you didn’t identify? Ask yourself a bunch of questions, learn through the
                Socratic method. Tear down the project and understand how it was built.
              </p>
              <p>When you start getting really good at this, the next thing you can try is reverse engineering. Find a
                small project on GitHub made by a reputable programmer, download the app. Run it and see all of its
                functionality. Play around with it.</p>

              <p>Then build it from scratch and once you’re done, compare your code to their code. Are there efficiency
                gains that you could have made? Are there solutions to things you couldn’t figure out? Now you’re really
                getting into the big leagues.</p>
