            <h1># 1ST DAY "Falling marshmallows":</h1>
            <p>It all started with total silence… It was super awkward at the beginning but the spaghetti marshmallow
              change helped a lot (I’ve not been sweating like this in ages) it was really interesting and I’m excited
              about the course at GA.</p>
            <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">[Coding Bootcamps, Data Science, UX, Business | General Assembly]</a>
            <p>
              Outcomes team come up before lunch: I was impressed with how honest and not shit giving they were: looks
              like they knew what they are talking about and are willing to help.
            </p>
            <p>
              The homework was to reflect on your Job Search Notebook your professional story so far, using the guiding
              questions:
              <ul>
                <li>*What first sparked your interest in the career you are studying for?*</li>
                <li> *Why are you excited about this new pathway and discipline?*</li>
                <li> *What are your greatest skills at present, before the course?*</li>
                <li>*What are your short-term career goals?*</li>
              </ul>
              I think It’s vital to ask yourself these question and answer them honestly.
            </p>
            <i>
              I’ve decided for myself with a push from my friend who advised me to try it out coding and I simply fell
              in
              love with it and got curious. I started self-learning and was devoted. I never knew one can do so much
              with
              coding.
              I believe anyone agrees with me is when you do something and it’s 3 am and you lose track of time- this is
              PROBABLY the right thing for you, furthermore, if you keep doing in for months and still curious and
              motivated- this is DEFINITELY the right thing.
              With code bits, you can build anything from nothing. You can build enterprises, businesses, communities
              without nothing physical at all. It’s a pure art of thought. Ideas can become realities with the right
              tools
              and knowledge. Personally, I’m looking forward to gaining the knowledge required to become an expert in
              the
              IT industry to deliver good quality, helpful, on-demand, accessible products: mobile apps and/ or web
              sites.
              I’m thrilled about transferring my ideas into applications people can see and use. It’s a way for me to
              express
              my creativity. Software engineering is about constantly learning new things and challenging myself.
            </i>
            <p>
              After lunch, we were setting up tools and applications (stupidly I’ve updated to Catalina) So I had to ask
              the teacher to help me out. But in the end, we were able to figure it out. It was challenging but I felt
              accomplished after I managed to figure out most of the issues on my own.

              Not so terrified of terminal anymore- turned out when you read it, it helps you and tells you what to do
              so not a scary thing at all. Billion crazy scary symbols running on your screen are intimidating but one
              day I will be able to read this «Chinese». Another thing I've realized is how supportive the IT community
              is and how easy it is to find the right answers and help if needed. In the evening I was going through a
              welcome package and syllabus and additional information.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the first day was feeling ready and excited.
            </p>
            <h1> # DAY 2 "Anatomy":</h1>
            <p>
              During the second day, we went through main HTML tags and web page anatomy which was fairly easy because I
              already knew it.

              So we created a semantically correct web page and after lunch, we were studying CSS.

            <h1> # DAY 3 "CSS":</h1>
            <strong>
              For the 3rd day we were stronglaying a lot of games to practice our CSS skills:

            <h1> # DAY 4 "Flexing the industry":</h1>
            <p> On day four we had an outcome team talking bout London market and self- branding/self-search/ LinkedIn .
              We learned what do London hiring managers want in their talent?
              <p> <strong> Five key things!</strong></p>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>● Willingness to learn (Determination)</li>
              <li>● Excitement about what you do (Love of coding)</li>
              <li>● Someone who can hit the ground running and work in ever changing environments or different
                responsibilities (Adaptability)</li>
              <li> ● Bring your past experience and make it relevant (Transferable)</li>
              <li> ● You as a person! (Personality)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              And that there are <strong>many different resources</strong> out there for getting stuck into the
              developer community!
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> ● Meetups & events</li>
              <li> ● Conferences</li>

              During our coding classes, we were working with Flex-box which I finally understood. Homework was to
              re-created Instagram welcome page for both desktop and mobile using flex-box and media selector. I
              finished at 10:40 pm and went straight to bed.

              I had a bit of an issue figuring out how to distinguish with style id for mobile and which is for desktop:
