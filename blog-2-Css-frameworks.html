          Pros and Cons of Using a CSS Framework
        </h1>

          <div class="text">
            <h1>Bulma framework, man it was hard!</h1>
            <p>
              I have never read the documentation before and have never worked with CSS frameworks, so it took me a
              while
              to get through the web site and figure it out.</p>
            <p>
              Frameworks I though easy and everyone can do it.
              Turns our frameworks are very powerful tool once you know how to use them and you still can do custom-made
              web sites and reveal your creative side with the help of frameworks. There a lot of frameworks out there
              and
              every framework offers something different and they all also vary in their size.
            </p>

            <h4>We will start with pros first and cons second. In each of these categories I will offer you five
              benefits or costs you will gain or pay. Let’s have a look …
              We will start with the pros first and cons second. In each of these categories, I will give you five
              advantages or disadvantages.</h4>
            <h1># Pros:</h1>
            <h4> *Low-barrier entry*</h4>
            <p> One of the perks is that you don’t require to have a bigger knowledge of programming. Understanding at
              least
              something is good, but it is not required. To make it easier for everyone, all frameworks offer rich and
              complete documentation on their websites. Whole content is usually broken down into individual parts by
              their main subject which makes it easy to find exactly what do you need.
            </p>
            <h4> * Complete User Interface *</h4>
            <p>If you want to build a seamless user experience you have to harmonize and unify all the elements. This
              includes buttons, navigation, typography, behavior (scripts) and various other assets. It takes a lot of
              time when you have to do all on your own, but with the help of frameworks, it's way easier.
            </p>
            <h4> * Grid System *</h4>
            <p> Lately, grids are a big subject appearing everywhere in web design.</p>
            <p>
              Because of its popularity, many different systems were designed and the new ones are still evolving. You
              can
              choose from two types of grids. First one is fixed – they are tailored to certain resolution – and the
              second one is fluid – in most scenarios percentage-based grid systems.
            </p>
            <h4> * Maintenance *</h4>
            <p>
              When you work with a certain framework, one of the perks is the fact that there are many people taking
              care
              of the code. There is no need from your side to debug every line or check if you didn’t make any typos or
              mistakes. Everything is ready to use.
            </p>
            <h4> * Stability *</h4>
            <p> Frameworks are well tested on different devices and browsers by a huge group of people. They are also
              open-source so anyone who spots some bugs or issues can either reach the support team or fix it on their
              own.
            </p>
            <h1># Cons: </h1>
            <h4> * Learning *</h4>
            <p>
              One of the downsides to using frameworks is the need to learn their syntax to be ready to work with them.
              Since every framework is from the different creator(s), when you decide to change them, you also have to
              learn the syntax all over again.
            </p>

            <h4> * Unnecessary Code *</h4>
            <p>To suit the various needs of all the people who might work with a framework, it has to be ready for
              everything. Because of this, they are often filled with a great number of styles and scripts you might not
              use at all.</p>

            <h4> * Similarity *</h4>
            <p> If you don’t like your website to look like others, you will presumably have a hard time. While some of
              them
              include only the basic foundation (HTML and simple CSS), others come fully styled up. Navigation, forms,
              elements, buttons, text … All of it is already styled in a certain way and you can either spend some time
              editing those rules or get used to it. This can limit your creative freedom and put unnecessary
              limitations
              to your work.
            </p>
            <h4> * Additional Customization *</h4>
            <p> This follows the previous issue of similarity, but now it is more about the code than visuals. Many
              frameworks include strong architecture covering the behavior of elements too. Whenever you will want to
              alter these properties, you will have to find that specific code and modify it by yourself.
            </p>
            <h4> * Dependence *</h4>
            <p>
              You are not the author of the framework. This makes you dependent on someone else. When the author(s)
              decide
              to, for example, drop support for certain browser or modify some part of frameworks, you will have to
              adjust
              to that change (or stay with older version).
            </p>

            <strong> *
              Frameworks comes with various gains and pains you have to consider when deciding about to use some of
              them.
              These gains and pains will vary in their importance according to your skills and needs. However, choose
              wisely.
